# Activity Minimization of Misinformation Influence in Online Social Networks

An educational Java project that demonstrates graph-based greedy node blocking to reduce potential misinformation spread, together with a simple Bloom-filter-based spam keyword screening component.

## Technologies
- Java
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Graph data structures
- Greedy heuristic
- Bloom filter

## Algorithm
The demo represents a social network as an undirected graph G(V,E). Nodes represent users and edges represent relationships. A greedy heuristic repeatedly chooses a high-impact candidate node and marks it as blocked.

The demo also uses a Bloom filter to perform fast probabilistic membership checks for spam-related keywords.

## Run the Java project
From the project root:

```bash
mkdir out
javac -d out src/Main.java
java -cp out Main
```

## Run the web interface
Open `web/index.html` in a browser.

The web interface is a standalone demonstration. The Java algorithm runs separately from the static frontend in this version.

## Limitations
The graph is a small synthetic example. It is not a production social-network moderation system and does not connect to Twitter, Facebook, or other live platforms.

## Resume description
**Misinformation Influence Minimization:** Developed a Java-based graph algorithm using a greedy node-blocking heuristic to reduce potential misinformation influence, with a Bloom-filter-based spam screening component and HTML/CSS/JavaScript interface.
